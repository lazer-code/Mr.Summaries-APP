/**
 * CourseSummariesFragment - simplified version that doesn't rely on generated
 * view-binding or SafeArgs classes. This avoids "unresolved reference" errors
 * while layout-binding and SafeArgs are not set up in the project.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - layout file: res/layout/fragment_course_summaries.xml
 *   - TextView with id = @+id/text_subject_title
 *   - RecyclerView with id = @+id/recycler_view_summaries
 *   - TextView with id = @+id/text_no_summaries
 *
 * Navigation:
 * - This fragment expects an argument named "subject" in the fragment arguments Bundle.
 *   If you are navigating with SafeArgs you can keep using that, otherwise set:
 *     val bundle = Bundle().apply { putString("subject", "Math") }
 *     findNavController().navigate(R.id.courseSummariesFragment, bundle)
 *
 * - When a summary is clicked we navigate to R.id.summaryFragment and pass the Summary
 *   object as a Serializable under the key "summary". Ensure your SummaryFragment reads
 *   it from arguments (it was declared Serializable in models.Summary).
